        <p>This Website is being created for a family member of mine, Sue Lemke, she likes recycling and taking apart old electronics instead of them being thrown away</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The website will be organized with headers, to make easy navigation between the different pages.</li>
            <li>We can easily make sure that this website has ten pages, as there are a lot of topics regarding recycling as a whole.</li>
            <li>To start, we're going to be using navigation links to link together multiple different pages.</li>
            <li>The website will have images not only to make the website look better, but also to help the user understand specifc parts about recycling, like allowed/disallowed items.</li>
            <li>Files will be named in lowercase.</li>
            <li>We will have an external link, most likely to something regarding recycling information.</li>
            <li>Code will be easily readable, with resonable names that explain the purpose of what they do.</li>
            <li>Users will be able to log in, so that we can have a database, either SQL or a Flask implementation.</li>
            <li>Header, footer, and navbar will be included.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We have a pretty good idea of what the endgoal of the webiste will be. My groupmates and I talked about this idea together, so that we have a cohesive idea of what we want to do</p>
