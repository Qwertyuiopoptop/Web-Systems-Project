        <h1><center>Group 2 Project Proposal</center></h1>
        <h2><center>Camille Doering, Web Systems</center></h2>
        <p>This website is being created for Sue Lemke, regarding a recycling business, and will meet the required objectives for this project as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The webiste will have headers, to differentiate between different pages and topics.</li>
            <li>The site will have at least 10 pages, dedicated to a variety of general topics, and more specific ones.</li>
            <li>This site will have navigation links to allow users to navigate between different pages.</li>
            <li>Images will be provided, to allow users a better visual idea of what they are looking at, for pages such as one which lists different types of recyclable objects.</li>
            <li>Files will be clearly named, in lowercase, and well-organized.</li>
            <li>There will be at least one external link, maybe to something such as govt. sites detailing certain recycling based acts.</li>
            <li>Source code will be well formated, with logical and meaningful class and ID names.</li>
            <li>Header, footer, and navbar will be included.</li>
            <li>Users will have a way to log in, and their information may be saved using a database, maybe SQL?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>My groupmates and I have a rough idea of what the website will look like, and have discussed this with each other.</p>
